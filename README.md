## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.0.0 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd vnedraid-frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

## Configuration

The application can be configured using the `src/config/config.ts` file. This file contains settings for:

- API base URL
- Environment (development, production)
- Debug mode

You can modify these settings based on your environment needs. For production, update the `prodConfig` object in this file.

## API Documentation

The API documentation is available in OpenAPI format in the `openapi.yaml` file in the root directory. This documentation describes all endpoints, request/response formats, and data models used by the application.

Since the backend API is not available during development, this documentation serves as a reference for implementing the frontend and creating mock data.
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

  environment: 'development',
  debug: true,
};
```

For production builds, update the API URL to your production backend.

## API Documentation

The API documentation is available in the OpenAPI format in `src/api/openapi.json`. This file can be used to generate API clients or to explore the API using tools like Swagger UI.
